# Lexical-Analyzer
This project implements a Lexical Analyzer using a finite state automaton (DFA) in C++. It reads mathematical expressions from a file, tokenizes them, and classifies each token based on predefined states.

Features

1. Recognizes integers, floating-point numbers, variables, and operators.
2. Uses a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) for token validation.
3. Supports arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), assignment (=), and parentheses ((, )).
4. Reads input from a text file and processes it efficiently.
5. Outputs the detected tokens along with their types.

Usage

Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable and provide the path to the file containing expressions.
The program will output the recognized tokens and their classifications.
